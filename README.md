- 👋 Hi, I’m @mariohidalgosoria
- 👀 I’m a physicist interested in modelling and simulating complex phenomena: from intracellular transport to fluctuations in financial markets.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to link Laplace diffusion (diffusing diffusivity/hetroscedasticity) to interacting particle systems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve new algorithms for characterizing time series using deep/machine learning.  
- 📫 You can reach me at mariohidalgosoria@gmail.com
